This repository aims to compile every Elite Dangerous related LEGO build into one place. If you wish to contribute keep reading.

## Contributing

To contribute you must have a 3D model created in a program like [BrickLink Studio](https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page). 

1.  Create a folder under the ship which you wish to submit a design, name the folder after your GitHub username.
2.  In this folder you should have your 3D model and optionally instructions and renders.
3.  Name the 3D model the ship's name followed by the skin and the version number -- version number is not referring to the name of the ship, this is to allow you to submit multiple version of the ship under your name.
    Example: `adder - stock - v1.io` or `krait mk ii- squadron red - v2`
4.  Create a pull request.

Please only submit high quality/effort builds.
